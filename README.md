**`BIMManager / VisualProgramer`**


👷‍♀️ Architect & BIM Manager | 🖥️ Exploring Visual Programming for AEC Automation.
🏗️ As an Architect and BIM Manager, I bring design expertise to the realm of digital construction. My journey into the world of programming focuses on visual languages to automate processes in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.
🤖 Currently mastering Python 🐍, Dynamo for Revit 🔌, and Grasshopper 🌿 to bridge the gap between creativity and technology in the AEC sector. My goal is to create efficient workflows, enhance collaboration, and optimize building design through code-driven solutions.
🔗 Let's connect and collaborate on the exciting intersection of architecture, technology, and automation!
